                        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">In 2014 Fred Meyer’s corporate offices agreed to allow our Lake City community to transform a green strip directly south from their Lake City location into a community garden. This was a direct result of volunteer efforts by Lake City Future First.</p>

                                <p>The goal of the garden is to provide our economically and culturally diverse community a chance to work together to transform a common area into something that will provide a sense of pride and a variety of volunteer opportunities.</p>
                                
                                <p>Although the project has languished a bit much has happened in preparation to begin work on the space. Two community survey processes, professional design recommendations, multiple opportunities for public input and relationship building with Fred Meyer have all been wonderful components to the process. Out of the process the community has identified that improvements to the space would concentrate on aesthetics and ecology. Few would argue that the current space lacks visual appeal. This location is highly visible – viewed by thousands of commuters each day. The transformation would help change perceptions about the area and encourage potential consumers to stop by our civic core.  The space also offers a pedestrian passage for people traveling from Lake City Way to 33rd Avenue and back. The potential to book end one of the most diverse streets in the City with the future park on 33rd Avenue adds a new level of excitement.</p>

                                <p>The location’s proximity to 33rd offers a unique engagement opportunity to work with many under-represented groups within our neighborhood. The main goal of the garden has been broad community outreach, volunteer opportunities, community building and a chance for educational opportunities. For example, the Little Brooke culvert runs under the space and is day lighted a short distance away as it joins Thornton Creek.</p>
                                
                                <p>The current state of the process is ensuring that issues such as the lease agreement and the insurance requirements are something that we are able to take on. We have also realized what a great opportunity this is to report back to the community on how a process like this unfolds. The educational opportunities inherent in this type of project need to be fully explored.</p>
                                
                                <p>One of the major concerns that we have heard is regarding the safety and maintenance of the space which has led us to realize that more conversation and solid planning for the success of the project are needed.</p>
